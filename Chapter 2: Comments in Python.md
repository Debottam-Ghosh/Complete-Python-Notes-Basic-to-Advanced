# Chapter 2: Comments in Python

<br>
<br>

## Definition
Comments are notes in your code to explain what it does. Python **ignores them** during execution — they’re just for humans.

---

### **Single Line Comment:** Start with the `#` symbol.
```bash
# This is a single-line comment
x = 5  # Assign 5 to x
```
### **Multi Line Comment:** 
#### Python **does not have** true multi-line comments, but you can use multiple `#`
```bash
# This is a multi-line comment
# written over
# several lines.
```

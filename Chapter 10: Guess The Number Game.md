# Chapter 10: Guess The Number Game

<br>
<br>

### Rules:
- The computer secretly picks a random number between 1 and 100. You don’t know what it is — your job is to figure it out by guessing.
- You type in a number you think might be correct — say, 45.
- It tells you if your guess is:
    - **Too low** → meaning the secret number is higher than what you guessed.
    - **Too high** → meaning the secret number is lower than what you guessed.
    - **Correct** → 🎉 You win!
- Based on the feedback, you adjust your next guess:
    -  If it said “too low,” you try a higher number.
    -  If it said “too high,” you try a lower number.
- This continues until you guess the number correctly. And also it will show you the number of attempts.
